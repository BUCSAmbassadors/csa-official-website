## Deployment

Any push or merge to branch "prod" will automatically deploy to https://csa-official-website.herokuapp.com/ with Heroku.

## The Technology

This website is an HTML/SCSS/JS website that utilizes a Node.js/Express.js back-end for server-side processes. Be sure to download Node and npm ([found here](https://nodejs.org/en/)). Rellax.js was used for the parallax effect. Most of the mobile responsiveness of the website uses flexbox and the Contact Us page uses Grid CSS. Nodemailer is used for the contact form.

npm start
```
